# Tournament_AA

A simple yet effective strategy for the Iterated Prisoner’s Dilemma tournament. This "Strict Cooperator" starts friendly
and tolerates occasional defections, but switches to permanent defection if the opponent repeatedly betrays. Built with
performance and compliance in mind — no external libraries, fast execution, and fully tournament-ready.
